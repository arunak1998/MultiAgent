🚀 What it does:
Instead of just making a report, your system creates a mission plan from a topic.

🗣 Prompt:
“I want to build a startup for AI in Mental Health”

The system doesn’t just give you facts.
It comes back with:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
📍 What to learn → Top papers, concepts, tools
🛠️ What to build → MVP ideas, APIs, risks
👥 Who to talk to → Experts, founders, investors
📊 How to measure → KPIs, metrics, case studies
📝 Next steps → Tools, roadmaps, checklist
💥 Why this is 🔥🔥
It doesn’t just summarize — it generates a plan

It’s like an AI Project Coach or AI Venture Builder

Could be applied to:

Learning plans (e.g. “I want to master LangGraph in 2 weeks”)

Startup builders

Policy action plans

Non-profit ideas

Research-based grant proposals

🧠 Multi-Agent Breakdown
Agent	What it Does
🎩 SupervisorAgent	Orchestrates the mission
📚 ResearchAgent	Gets raw insights & trends
🧠 StrategyAgent	Converts info into goals & actions
📊 MetricAgent	Defines how to measure outcomes (KPI/OKRs)
📝 TaskAgent	Builds checklist & roadmap
📄 ReportAgent	Formats into Notion doc, slide deck, or docx

📐 How It’s Different from Just Research:
Typical Research Bot	MissionPlanner AI
Just gives info	Gives structured action
Output = summary	Output = plan, metrics, tools
Passive	Proactive & adaptive
Static	Learns & revises plan with feedback

⚒️ Tech Stack Ideas
LangGraph → agent routing + memory + fallbacks

GPT-4o → context-aware generation

Serper API, Arxiv, Crunchbase API, News API → source info

python-docx or Notion API → plan/document output

LangChain Agents with tools like search, calculator, embedding

ChromaDB → for knowledge memory of missions

🔁 Bonus Ideas to Build On
🔄 Feedback Loop: You can say “this doesn’t help” → it rewrites the plan

🧑‍💻 Custom Roles: “Make the plan from a developer’s POV”

🎯 Niche Mode: Education plans, Startup launches, Government missions

✅ Want a Starting Example?
Prompt: "I want to reduce food waste in Bangalore using AI"

Output:

🔍 Research: Sources, causes of food waste

🛠️ MVP: AI-based inventory forecasting system

🤝 Collab: NGOs like Feeding India

📈 KPIs: Tons saved/week, households helped

✅ Tasks: Data collection, pilot launch, partnerships
